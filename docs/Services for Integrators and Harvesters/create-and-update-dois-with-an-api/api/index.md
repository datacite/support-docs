## About the DataCite REST API

The [DataCite REST API](https://support.datacite.org/reference) enables creation and update of DataCite DOI metadata records and account information. 

The API is generally RESTful and returns results in JSON (following the [JSON:API](http://jsonapi.org/) specification).

### REST API Guide

These guides will walk you through the basic operations of the DataCite REST API for creating and updating DOIs and metadata:

- [Creating DOIs with the REST API](doc:api-create-dois)
- [Updating metadata with the REST API](doc:updating-metadata-with-the-rest-api)

### Additional resources

- Our [DataCite API Training](https://youtu.be/mh_r6ohJOac) video walks through the basics of the REST API.
- Fork the [DataCite REST API Training collection](https://www.postman.com/datacite/workspace/datacite-rest-api-training/overview) on Postman to explore examples.

## Member vs. Public API

The REST API is split into two versions: a Public API and a Member API. Traffic is directed to a different set of servers if users authenticate:

- [Member API](https://support.datacite.org/v1.8/docs/api#member-api-requires-authentication): Accessed **with** authentication: used for **creating and updating metadata**
- [Public API](https://support.datacite.org/v1.8/docs/rest-api#public-api-no-authentication): Accessed **without** authentication: used for **retrieving metadata**

These two APIs use the same URL (starting with <https://api.datacite.org>) and run the same code. When users authenticate to access the Member API, they have access to additional functionality, depending on their account type.

### Member API (Requires authentication)

Authentication provides access to additional functionality to create and update DOIs, view draft records and Registered DOIs, and view contact information.

Users must authenticate with a Repository account to create and update DOIs.

| Account Type                              | Create and update DOIs | View draft records and Registered (non-Findable) state DOIs | View organization contact information |
| :---------------------------------------- | :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| Repository                                | x                      | x                                                           |                                       |
| Member (Direct Member or Consortium Lead) |                        | x                                                           | x                                     |
| Consortium Organization                   |                        | x                                                           | x                                     |

## Test vs. Production

The REST API is available in both test and production. Many examples in this guide use the test endpoint.

- Test endpoint: <https://api.test.datacite.org>
- Production endpoint: <https://api.datacite.org>

Learn more about the differences between Test and Production in our [Testing Guide](https://support.datacite.org/docs/testing-guide).

## API Versions

The current version of the REST API is version 2. Endpoints like `/works`, `/members`, and `/data-centers` correspond to [version 1](doc:api-v1), which is [now deprecated](doc:datacite-rest-api-legacy-endpoints-deprecation).
